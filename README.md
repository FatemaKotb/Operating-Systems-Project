# Operating-Systems-Project
This project is a simulation of an operating system scheduler. It provides the flexibility to choose from Highest Priority First (HPF), Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN), and Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithms for process management. Additionally, it employs the Buddy System for memory management.
